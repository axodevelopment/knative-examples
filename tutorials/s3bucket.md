  what a wild review but

  Kamelet properties map to kameletbinding.

  knative 'traits' auto sync / discover in the cluster... not sure if this isn't working
  using url (local)

  the integration is a builder of a kamelete based upon binding and sink/ source components connected.  the resulting image needs a managed image registry to connect to.
